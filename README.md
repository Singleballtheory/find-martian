Our search began in earnest shortly after Curiosity landed within Gale crater on November 26, 2011. Experts agreed this could be a likely landing location of a Sasquatch were they to have built their own space ship and travelled to Mars. Images of the area however proved unfruitful. (images from first two years of Curiosity) After two years' time it was deemed a good idea to send Curiosity to a new location. (next page)



Onto whatever:

For the next 10 years Curiosity's search continued with presumably every stone left unturned because, well, Curiosity can't turn over stones. On August 9th, 2021, Curiosity took this image (image here) which reveals an object hovering -- perhaps even flying -- within Mars' atmosphere. Further images indicated the object landed somewhere behind a rock mass. Curiosity followed. (next page)


Footprints:

At a robust .08699 mph Curiosity gave pursuit to the only viable lead it had ever discovered, taking ground photos along the way which seem to indicate footprints. (image of footprint). Then suddenly, Sasquatch's house. 

And as though there could still be any possible doubt, Sasquatch himself, presumably on his way to the mailbox (mailbox not shown).
