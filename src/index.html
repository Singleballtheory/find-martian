      <h1>Redfoot: Sasquatch on Mars</h1>
      <p>On November 26th, 2011, and after decades of failed study by Earth's most renowned scientific minds, <br>NASA launched the Curiosity rover to Mars for one expressed purpose:<br><br>To find Sasquatch.<br><br>After nine active years and billions of dollars invested, we here at NASA have reason to believe <br>Sasquatch has in fact been found. On Mars. Just walking around. <br><br>View our proof here.<br><br>Or if you prefer, bring up any date in the field below to view images taken by the Curiosity rover <br>and discover Sasquatch for yourself.</p>

            <p>Our search began in earnest shortly after Curiosity landed within Gale crater on November 26, 2011. Experts agreed this could be a likely landing location of a Sasquatch were they to have built their own space ship and travelled to Mars. Images of the area however proved unfruitful. After two years' time it was deemed a good idea to send Curiosity to a new location.</p>
