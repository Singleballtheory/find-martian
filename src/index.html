      <h1>Redfoot: Sasquatch on Mars</h1>
      <p>On November 26th, 2011, and after decades of failed study by Earth's most renowned scientific minds, <br>NASA launched the Curiosity rover to Mars for one expressed purpose:<br><br>To find Sasquatch.<br><br>After nine active years and billions of dollars invested, we here at NASA have reason to believe <br>Sasquatch has in fact been found. On Mars. Just walking around. <br><br> <span class="viewProof">View our proof here</span>.<br><br>Or if you prefer, bring up any date in the field below to view images taken by the Curiosity rover <br>and discover Sasquatch for yourself.</p>

          <p>Our search began in earnest shortly after Curiosity landed within Gale crater on November 26, 2011. Experts agreed this could be a likely landing location of a Sasquatch were they to have built their own space ship and travelled to Mars. Images of the area however proved unfruitful. After two years' time it was deemed a good idea to send Curiosity to a <span class="newLocation">new location</span>.</p>

          <p>For the next 10 years Curiosity's search continued with presumably every stone left unturned because, well, Curiosity can't turn over stones. On August 9th, 2021, Curiosity took this image which reveals an object hovering -- perhaps even flying -- within Mars' atmosphere. Further images indicated the object landed somewhere behind a rock mass. <span class="curiosityFollowed">Curiosity followed</span>.</p>
